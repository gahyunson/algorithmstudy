# Journey of algorithm
Welcome to my journey record of algorithm repository!   
This repository contains what I learned about algorithms and how I applied them to practice problems.

## Study Group Algorithm
The 'Leetcode' folder contains the materials and solutions for our algorithm study group sessions.   
Our study period spans from *January 8, 2024, to June 18, 2024*, with meetings held every Tuesday.

### Schedule
- Duration: January 8, 2024 - June 18, 2024
- Meetings: Every Tuesday
- Goals:   
  Theory Presentation: Each week, one member will present an algorithm theory along with its implementation in code.   
  Problem Solving: Each week, we will solve one problem from LeetCode and discuss the solution.   
  Repository Structure
- The repository is organized into the following folders:
    Theory: Contains theoretical explanations and code implementations of the algorithms presented each week.
    DataStructure: Contains solutions to the problems from LeetCode that we solve during our sessions.

- Folder Details
  Theory: In this folder, you will find:
    - Detailed explanations of various algorithms.
    - Code implementations in a programming language of choice.
    - Examples to illustrate how the algorithms work.

  DataStructure: In this folder, you will find:
  - Problem statements from LeetCode.
  - Solution code files.
  - Explanations of the solution approach and complexity analysis.
  - Contribution Guidelines

- Presenting a Theory:    
  Prepare a detailed explanation of the algorithm.   
  Provide a code implementation.   
  Include examples to demonstrate the algorithm.   
  Solving a LeetCode Problem:

Solve the problem individually before the session.    
Share and discuss your solution during the session.    
Upload your solution to the DataStructure folder with appropriate comments and explanation.
