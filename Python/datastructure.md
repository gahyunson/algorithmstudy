*Let's make a queue structure without 'array'!*

in javascript,  
Below is adding and removing mechanism of a queue in javascript.
- adding item in front of an array - > array.unshift()
- removing something in the end of an array - > array.pop()

Queue is ... good for complicated problem.

Create a new, empty queue
`const q = new Queue();`

Add a record to a queue 
`q.add(1);`

Remove record at the end of a queue
`q.remove();`
